## Technical Details

### Architecture
The game uses a modular design with separate components:

- `game.py` - Main game loop and state management
- `ui.py` - User interface and menu systems  
- `car.py` - Car animation and movement logic
- `words.py` - Word generation and movement
- `particles.py` - Visual effects and animations
- `audio.py` - Sound effect management
- `assets.py` - Procedural graphics and embedded assets
- `leaderboard.py` - Score persistence  
- `settings.py` - Configuration management

### Asset Generation
All graphics and sounds are generated procedurally at runtime - no external files needed! The `assets.py` module creates:

- Chibi car graphics using pygame shapes
- Pastel UI elements with rounded corners
- Sound effects using mathematical waveforms
- Particle effects for celebrations

### Data Persistence
Game data is stored locally in JSON files:
- `data/settings.json` - User preferences
- `data/leaderboard.json` - High scores

## Building Executable

See `BUILD_NOTES.md` for instructions on creating standalone executables with PyInstaller.

## License

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
python tests/smoke_test.py
```

### Code Structure
The codebase follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive docstrings, and type hints where appropriate.
